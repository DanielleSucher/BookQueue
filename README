To set up your own version on Heroku, you'll need to get the free Scheduler and Mailgun addons, and set up a daily task for bin/reminder.py.

To set up the database on Heroku, follow these steps:

    in the command line:
      heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev
      heroku pg:promote HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_COLOR (where COLOR is whatever you got back from the prior command)
      heroku run python
    in the heroku python terminal:
      from app import db
      db.create_all()
